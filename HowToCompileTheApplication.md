# Introduction #

You can get and compile DelphiCodeCoverageWizard source code as long as you respect the MPL license.

This page list all steps to compile the application.

# Preconditions #

## Delphi XE ##

I'm using **Embarcadero Delphi XE** with Update 1 to build DelphiCodeCoverageWizard.

You might be able to use a older version (at least Delphi 2009) but I haven't test such thing.

## JCL-JVCL library ##

DelphiCodeCoverageWizard heavily use JVCL components and some JCL classes.

I'm using the latest stable release (JVCL340CompleteJCL221-Build3845) but I'm sure any version will work (older version or a daily build).

You can get JCL-JVCL from here : http://sourceforge.net/projects/jvcl/

## DelphiCodeCoverageWizard source code ##

Of course, the latest thing you need is the project source code.

The best way to get it is through subversion.
See information on the project's [Source tab](http://code.google.com/p/delphi-code-coverage-wizard/source/checkout).
